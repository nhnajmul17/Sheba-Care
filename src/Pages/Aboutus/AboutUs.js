                <p>Sheba Care is a private hospital established with a particularly strong presence of doctors in Bangladesh. Our first facility was established with approximately 50 operational beds. The hospital now features over 500 operational beds through a combination of greenfield projects and acquisitions. We believe that the "Sheba Care" brand is strongly associated with our mission to deliver high-quality, affordable healthcare services to the broader population by leveraging our economies of scale, skilled doctors, and an efficient business model.</p>
